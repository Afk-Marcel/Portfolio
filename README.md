# Javascript added CV

## Description

This is a simple web model for a CV I created to showcase my abilities using html, scss, javascript. The project has 4 pages with a saving function, liking function, dropdown menu and animations such as hiding/showing and sliding headings. It includes a commenting area as well as an area to contact me with.
