            Cycling is a big part of my life, it has given me many adventures and excitement. The feeling you get when riding
            <br />
            through nature makes you feel relaxed and it's a great getaway from everything else in your life. I started
            cycling
            <br />
            about 2 years ago and have enjoyed it ever since. I'm not a professional cyclist but my record is 50km since I
            <br />
            began cycling which I see as an achievement.
